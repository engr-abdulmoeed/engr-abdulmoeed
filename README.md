👋  Hi, I’m @engr-abdulmoeed

I'm an ex-electrical engineer who got zapped by the coding bug ⚡️. Now I'm on a mission to conquer the world of Python, one line of code at a time. 

👀  I’m interested in ...

* Building awesome things with code! (Especially backend stuff)
* Mastering the art of Django
* Unveiling the mysteries of Machine Learning

🌱  I’m currently learning ...

The power of Django - I'm on a quest to become a Django Jedi ️

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

* Python projects - big or small, let's build something cool!
* Anything Django-related - if you have a project, I'm your guy!
* Machine Learning adventures - I'm eager to learn and contribute

📫  How to reach me ...

Feel free to send me a message here on GitHub or shoot me an email (you can find it in my profile). Let's connect and create something amazing!

⚡  Fun fact:

Before diving into code, I used to wrangle electrons for a living (yes, I was an electrical engineer). Now I wrangle code instead - some might say it's less shocking
